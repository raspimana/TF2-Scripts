# Tvde1's TF2 Configs

## Introduction
Hi!
These are my TF2 configs for all classes.
I'll try to comment on what every line does, if there are any questions, just ask.
Feel free to edit the configs to your own liking!

## General information on scripting
From the Official Team Fortress Wiki https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting
> Scripting is the use of configuration files (.cfg) to create new keybinds and aliases automating complex behaviors and console command sequences. Unlike hacking, scripting is built into Team Fortress 2 and is not banned by VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat). Uses of scripting vary from simply binding a key to a command to self-referential loops and nested aliases that redefine one another. Any functionality that can be created with scripting can also be accomplished without it, but scripting allows these functionalities to be used in the heat of battle.

## List of default keys
This is a list of default keys for the PC version of Team Fortress 2.
https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_default_keys

## Installation
You can download this GitHub repository as a .zip and extract all the files into
- Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\
- OSX: Volume/Users/~username/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/team fortress 2/tf/cfg/
- Linux: ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team\ Fortress\ 2/tf/custom/

You can delete README.md though as it serves no function in game.  
Also make sure you have no scripts in `\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg` that have the same name as these.
You should update it regularly, and scan through the README.md to see if I have added something.

## Maps
As you can see, I have a few aliasses that start up maps. You can only use them if you've downloaded the maps. It is optional, you don't have to download them.
Those maps are
- tr_walkway_rc2
- tr_aim
- tr_aim_practice

## Final words.
Feel free to edit this to your own liking. But please refer to me (and this page) if you will upload this code somewhere.
Message me if you encounter any bugs, I'd be glad to help and fix it. You can also message me if you know any improvements.  
Also, check out [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/1tvde1) for some cool TF2 videos! (Mostly spy frags and fun related.)
